Title: Diagnostic tests for missing always at random
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Iavor", "Bojinov", email = "iav.bojinov@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Performs multiple tests for the missing always at random assumption
    in multivariate data. Each of the diagnostic tests also suggest which 
    variables are the most likely to violate the assumptions of the test. 
    Although missing always at random is not a necessary condition to ensure 
    validity under the Bayesian and direct-likelihood paradigms, it is 
    sufficient, and evidence for its violation should encourage the careful 
    statistician to conduct targeted sensitivity analyses. The package also
    implements several missing data mechanisms which can be useful for checking
    the performance for methods that handle missing data.
